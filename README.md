:octocat: 
*We have created this School Course Management Database System with **our project team members** 
**_@zeynepozturk_**  and **_@seymanurerkul_**  by using java programming language.
Java Swing is used to create window-based applications.
Eclipse has been used as an project IDE.

*Our Database is designed for both School classes and Course classes at the weekends.

*We aimed to create fast and simple management system experience
for the users.

*  The School-Course Management System is a student enrollment
management system.The School-Course Management System has three
accessors which are Manager, Teacher and Student.All actors must be logged in
to use the system.

*  At the login page, each person (student, teacher, manager) enrolls the
system by filling his/her information such as first name ,last name, gender,
phone number, birthdate and email address. If the person is a member of the
system then, the system pops up the warning message. System members enter
the system through the sign in page by id and password.

*  The school has it’s compulsory lessons for the week days, elective
courses for all students and optional mock exams for only eight grade students
on the weekends.

*  A teacher is only associated with one specialized lesson or course. Each
compulsory lesson has a designated credit and day in a week. At the login page,
the student details are entered.Then compulsory lessons are taken , elective
courses and course teachers are chosen.The Student is tracked on the basis of
the ID taken in the login page.

*  In routine students can elect a course if the quota of the course has not
been filled yet. If the teacher has a day off or if the student is not accepted to the
course by the teacher then the student can not select the course . Only 8 th grade
students can select weekend mock exams. Student’s weekly schedule is given
to the student. Students can also view the number of students that already
enrolled for the specific course.
